UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

Authentication information audit support
----------------------------------------

There are some Active Directory attributes that are not secret, but
are relied on in some forms of authentication. Changes to these
attributes could indicate surreptitious activity. The
"dsdb_password_audit" and "dsdb_password_json_audit" debug classes now
log changes to the following attributes:

 * altSecurityIdentities
 * dNSHostName
 * msDS-AdditionalDnsHostName
 * msDS-KeyCredentialLink
 * servicePrincipalName

For the JSON logs, changes to these will be logged with the "action"
field set to "Auth info change".


vfs_streams_xattr can hold larger streams
-----------------------------------------

On Linux the size of a single extended attribute is limited to 65536
bytes of size. For some file systems, this is also the overall limit
of space for xattrs, but for example xfs can hold more than that 64k
of extended xattrs, although the individual xattr is still limited to
64k. Setting

streams_xattr:max xattrs per stream = 1

to a higher value than 1 will allow Samba to shard the stream to more
than one xattr. It has an artificial limit of 16 for a maximum stream
length of 1MB.
